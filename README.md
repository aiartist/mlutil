# Machine Learning in Action in Haskell

This is a project to translate the code examples in Peter Harrington's [Machine Learning in Action][pbharrin] into Haskell. I don't have a lot of free time so this will take some time.

## The plan

I plan to translate as many of the Python examples into Haskell as possible and to create a package of Haskell support functions (tentatively called [`mlutil`][mlutil]). I'll then contribute them to the [DataHaskell][dh] community if they might be of interest to others.
